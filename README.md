## Philosophy

Nimble has a vast array of unique, complex mechanics throughout its character
and monster design. The schemas contained here are not meant to provide
structure to every minute aspect of the game. You could not implement an AI to
play Nimble based on these schemas. They are however, meant to provide enough
structure for the core concepts to enable 1) exchanging these objects between
systems and 2) building semi-automated tools like encounter builders or
character sheets.
